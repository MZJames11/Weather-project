Prompt 1: Create a simple dynamic weather webpage using the MVC pattern. The webpage should:
- Allow users to input a city name and click a button to get the weather.
- Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data.
- Structure code into 5 files: index.html, style.css, model.js, view.js, and controller.js.
- No classes or constructors; create all objects as constants.
- All event handlers must be attached in HTML using attributes (e.g., onclick="functionName()").
- Include an additional feature: allow users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Dynamically change the background color based on the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- Add a tooltip when hovering over the weather icon.
